# Small Divide
#
# For each two things in the
# INBOX, how many times does
# the second fully fit into the
# first? Don't worry about
# negative numbers, divide by
# zero, or remainders.
#
# Self improvement tip: This
# might be a good time to
# practice copying and pasting
# from a previous assignment!
